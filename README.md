# ðŸš— Road Accident Risk Prediction

This project tackles the lack of data-driven methods for identifying high-risk accident zones.  
We built a **predictive model using Random Forest** trained on traffic, weather, and road condition data.  
The model achieved **90% accuracy**, providing actionable insights for **road safety planning** and **resource allocation**.
